# Barigui's Challenge

This project was intended to meet the criteria specified by the requirements document:

"Precisamos cadastrar os dados dos clientes que adentram em nossas lojas e qual o modelo de
 carro est√£o interessados.".

Since the document did not specify the data structre I just mocked some data using
- Costumer's name.
- Costumer's document (CPF).
- Car's model.
- Car's Year.
- Car's Plate.

It was made using C# and the latest version of .Net Core Web Api for the back-end. And for the front-end I used the latest version of Angular.

## How to run

Backend and frontend are expecting to run at specified adresses and ports:
- Back-end: `https://localhost:5001/api/`
- Front-end: `http://localhost:4200/`

Both dependencie's files can be found inside your own respective folder. In case of any doubt contact the creator.
