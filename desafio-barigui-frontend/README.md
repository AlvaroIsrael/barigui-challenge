# Desafio Barigui Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.
It was intended to meet the criteria specified in the requirements document:

"Precisamos cadastrar os dados dos clientes que adentram em nossas lojas e qual o modelo de
 carro est√£o interessados.".

Since the document did not specify the data structre I just mocked some data using
- Costumer's name.
- Costumer's document (CPF).
- Car's model.
- Car's Year.
- Car's Plate.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
